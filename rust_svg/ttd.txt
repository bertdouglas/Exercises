solve problem with multipage svg
  can't view it with firefox, chrome, inkscape
    just get a blank display

  maybe I need to use multiple numbered single page files




edit top comments for python version
  ready for showing

create second backup git remote on gitsrv1


done ---------------------------------------

move tests to separate file

verify how Option(Vec) works with serde json
  think it gives empty vec on read if not present
No it gives None when not present.

explore rust how it handles array initializers
  can't believe it can't size an array from number of initializers
  even c can do that
  must be missing something
  what happens if more or less initializers than data?
answer
  compiler warns if number of initializers is not matching declared size
  discovered no way to let it default
  annoying, but not dangerous

improve formating of svg output
  it is awkward because format string has to be a literal
  left margin either messes up code indenting, or output with extra spaces
  seems to show immaturity of rust
answer
  found macro indoc! and put inn use
  works ok, minor added clutter, a win
