Took a whack at fixing scaling.
Using absolute pixels in path.  All positive numbers.
Still using relative steps in DActs (drawing actions).

Also drawing layout boxes to help see where things are falling.

Have simple output, compact, can see all on one screen.
Not getting any path drawing.
Also getting repeat of the doc footer </body></html>
It shows up twice.

It seems that the path element cannot accept units in inches.
It is always in pixels.  And the coordinates must be integer values.
No fractions allowed.

I am still not sure I understand it correctly.
There are icons in svg which seem to have subpixel detail.
I also see that a "pixel" is defined to be 1/96 of an inch.
Obviously some screens have more or less resolution.
A 4k resolution 17 inch monitor will have about 300 pixels per inch.

Fractional pixels are allowed.
Inch units are not.
