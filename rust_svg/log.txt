It seems that the path element cannot accept units in inches.
It is always in pixels.  And the coordinates must be integer values.
No fractions allowed.

I am still not sure I understand it correctly.
There are icons in svg which seem to have subpixel detail.
I also see that a "pixel" is defined to be 1/96 of an inch.
Obviously some screens have more or less resolution.
A 4k resolution 17 inch monitor will have about 300 pixels per inch.

Fractional pixels are allowed.
Inch units are not.
