Check output formatting and indenting and commenting.
Want to look nice.

Double check all output appearance differences from previous python
version. Consider if it is appropriate to move to scheme where order is
automatically determined.  Would like to print simplest figure for
order 1 or order 0.  Try to make this happen.  May require adjusting
other orders to get pleasing output. This would mean that only the last
3 orders can be specified.

Indicate when lines from json file are ignored.

There is a bug in output html file.  Near end of file there is text
showing that looks like an svg path.  Then some of figures are
repeated. consider putting all the tunable parameters into a struct.
Seems like a buffer is not being cleared after a write.

fix plants so they are not upside down.
  the origin of postscript is lower left
  the origin of svg is upper left
  so y has flipped
  check the code for plants to see if there is a '|' at beginning
  consider rotating everything by setting initial direction +180,
  check the dragon against published images
    it seems to be rotated wrongly

make more fancy
  get more plants
  perhaps add color support for plants

write code to display the text parts in their boxes.

the choice of "order" is wrong in many cases.  Need a programmatic way
of finding the smallest order that draws anything.  I want to see the
simplest figure in the first box.  And I don't want to have to tune it
manually.
