fix plants so they are not upside down.
  the origin of postscript is lower left
  the origin of svg is upper left
  so y has flipped
  check the code for plants to see if there is a '|' at beginning
  consider rotating everything by setting initial direction +180,
  see how dragon looks as well

make more fancy
  get more plants
  perhaps add color support for plants

write code to display the text parts in their boxes.

need a new scheme for scaling, wildly off on things like the plants
  and the dragon.  probably need to go back to separate x size and y size and pick
  the biggest instead of averaging.

the choice of "order" is wrong in many cases.  Need a programmatic way of finding
the smallest order that draws anything.  I want to see the simplest
figure in the first box.  And I don't want to have to tune it manually.

redo the tunable parameters section.
  instead of look up table and parsing, just use static constants
  or perhaps lazy init.

Change all units to pixels and stop using inches
