Undo the github build actions that keep failing.  Not sure what I did
but undo it.

I think it is not necessary to manually enter the "post rules".
These rules could be automatically generated.  Any non action character
remaining gets converted to F.

Check output formatting and indenting and commenting.
Want to look nice.

Double check all output appearance differences from previous python
version. Consider if it is appropriate to move to scheme where order is
automatically determined.  Would like to print simplest figure for
order 1 or order 0.  Try to make this happen.  May require adjusting
other orders to get pleasing output. This would mean that only the last
3 orders can be specified.

Indicate when lines from json file are ignored.

make more fancy
  get more plants
  perhaps add color support for plants

the choice of "order" is wrong in many cases.  Need a programmatic way
of finding the smallest order that draws anything.  I want to see the
simplest figure in the first box.  And I don't want to have to tune it
manually.
