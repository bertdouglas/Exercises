Found problem.  Syntax error in stroke attribute.  Unknown color.

Installed chrome "validity" extension.  It did not show any problem. Or
maybe I couldn't get it to work.  One of those programs where no output
indicates no problem.  Anyway no help.

Also installed a debian package to validate generic xml.  It did not
find any error either.  Kind of makes sense.  This is inside of a
quoted string in attribute of svg path element.  I guess this requires
specialized svg parser.

Output now showing up almost perfectly aligned in layour box.
So change to only use perhaps 80 percent of available space.

Doing all curves.  Some bad scaling.  Bad order.  But no crashes.
Centering is good.  Figures look correct.

Plants are upside down.  This is probably because of the y-swap origin.

Took a whack at fixing scaling.
Using absolute pixels in path.  All positive numbers.
Still using relative steps in DActs (drawing actions).

Also drawing layout boxes to help see where things are falling.

Have simple output, compact, can see all on one screen.
Not getting any path drawing.
Also getting repeat of the doc footer </body></html>
It shows up twice.

It seems that the path element cannot accept units in inches.
It is always in pixels.  And the coordinates must be integer values.
No fractions allowed.

I am still not sure I understand it correctly.
There are icons in svg which seem to have subpixel detail.
I also see that a "pixel" is defined to be 1/96 of an inch.
Obviously some screens have more or less resolution.
A 4k resolution 17 inch monitor will have about 300 pixels per inch.

Fractional pixels are allowed.
Inch units are not.
