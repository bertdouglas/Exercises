Representation as Lindenmayer system
The Hilbert Curve can be expressed by a rewrite system (L-system).

Alphabet : A, B
Constants : F + −
Axiom : A
Production rules:
A → − B F + A F A + F B −
B → + A F − B F B − F A +
Here, "F" means "draw forward", "−" means "turn left 90°", "+" means "turn right 90°" (see turtle graphics), and "A" and "B" are ignored during drawing.
